This package provides the "StealthDriver" class. 
It is essentially a wrapper for selenium with undetected_chromedriver, with built in proxy retrieval and rotation, and randomized user agent.
A list of up-to-date proxies is generated on instantiation. GET requests can be made using the proxy_get() method. If rotating proxies is not required, the get() method can be used.
By default, the StealthDriver uses its own list of proxies to rotate through, but the user may also provide a list of proxies when using the proxy_get() method.
This functionality bundled together is very useful for web scraping and will get past most anti-bot measures. 
prerequisites:
    - Selenium
    - undetected_chromedriver
    - BeautifulSoup
    - fake_useragent

Usage:
    Creating a StealthDriver
    sd = StealthDriver(https=True, countries=["US", "UK", "Australia", etc...])
    
    GET request through rotating proxy
    sd.proxy_get(url, callback=None, **kwargs)
        - url to retrieve
        - optional callback function
        - keyword args for callback function

    GET request without proxy
    sd.get(url, callback=None, **kwargs)
        - url to retrieve
        - optional callback function
        - keyword args for callback function

    Create list of proxies (runs on instantiation)
    sd.get_proxies(https=True, countries=["US", "UK", "Australia", etc...])

    Return list of proxies
    sd.proxies
